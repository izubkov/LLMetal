The primary Rust libraries for **Apple Metal optimization** are focused on providing bindings to the Metal API and efficient GPU computation kernels:

- **metal-rs**: This is a popular crate offering Rust bindings for Apple's Metal framework. It allows you to launch GPU compute kernels from Rust and manage Metal devices/queues, but the actual kernels must be written in the Metal shading language (C++-like).youtube[crates](https://crates.io/crates/objc2-metal)
- **objc2-metal**: Another Rust binding for Metal, enabling direct control of the Metal API from Rust, suitable for projects needing low-level GPU management.[crates](https://crates.io/crates/objc2-metal)
- **bitnet-metal**: Specialized crate providing optimized GPU kernels (compute shaders) for BitNet operations on Apple Silicon, utilizing Metal for accelerated computations.[crates](https://crates.io/crates/bitnet-metal)
- Many relevant machine learning and GPGPU projects (such as candle by HuggingFace, fastllm, mistral.rs) use these bindings for launching and managing Metal-optimized computation workloads from Rust, though the kernel code itself is typically written in Metal shading language, not in Rust.[github](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/313)youtube
- Other wrappers and crates are listed in Rust registry sites but metal-rs and objc2-metal are generally the foundations for Metal work in Rust.[lib](https://lib.rs/os/macos-apis)

Most workflows involve writing Metal shader code, compiling it to a Metal library, and using a Rust host (with metal-rs/objc2-metal) to dispatch compute tasks to the GPU. This allows for Apple Metal optimization directly from Rust applications.youtube[crates+1](https://crates.io/crates/objc2-metal)
